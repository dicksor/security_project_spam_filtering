      "ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU: WE DELIVER YOUR PIZZA WITHOUT CONTACT Domino's Pizza attaches great importance to the health of its employees and customers. That is why Domino's Pizza Switzerland strictly adheres to the recommendations and regulations of the Federal Office of Public Health regarding the coronavirus. We do everything possible to ensure that customers can continue to enjoy their pizza comfortably and above all safely at work, in the home office or in the evening using Domino's Pizza's delivery service! To protect its employees and customers, Domino's Pizza was the first company to use contactless delivery and last week closed all take-away areas as a precautionary measure. In addition, the employees of Domino's Pizza Switzerland work under strict hygiene measures and keep a minimum distance. At Domino's Pizza, all ingredients are baked - in the oven at 250 degrees for 6 minutes - after which the pizza is placed directly into its box. From now on and as an extra measure, the pizza will no longer be sliced. Because Domino's controls the entire chain (production and delivery), we can guarantee the best possible hygiene conditions - from production to your door! Order online and we take care of everything! Domino’s Pizza Suisse #WECAREFORYOU #STAYATHOME\n",
